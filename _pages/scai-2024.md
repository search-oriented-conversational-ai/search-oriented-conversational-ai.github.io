### SCAI 2024
<i>CHIIR 2024, March 14, Sheffield, United Kingdom</i>

The Search-Oriented Conversational Artificial Intelligence workshop (SCAI) is a discussion platform on Conversational AI for intelligent information access, bringing together researchers and practitioners across natural language processing, information retrieval, machine learning and human-computer interaction fields. SCAI is an established venue with a <a href="/events/">long-standing tradition</a> of building bridges and integrating expertise from diverse research communities.

SCAI 2024 at <a href="https://chiir2024.github.io/">CHIIR</a> was the 8th iteration of SCAI. The workshop focused on the discussion between researchers from different fields as a strictly non-archival venue.
