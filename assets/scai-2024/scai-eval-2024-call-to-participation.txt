Call for participation: SCAI Eval 2024 Shared Task on Conversational Search
===========================================================================
Web page: https://scai.info/scai-eval-2024/

Conversational search has many faces. Rather than evaluating systems, this shared task calls on the community to gather comprehensive evaluation resources to provide a clearer picture of evaluation:

1. Example data of diverse search-oriented conversations (also small-scale);
2. Definitions and annotation guidelines for aspects to evaluate (e.g., correctness, coherence, readability); and
3. Implementations of evaluation metrics.

Both novel and already published contributions are welcome. Contributors will be invited to present at the next SCAI workshop (venue to be determined) and co-author a SIGIR Forum article.

Submission deadlines:
- January 15, 2024: deadline for new aspect definitions
- January 29, 2024: deadline for data and metrics
